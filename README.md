# BattleMetrics True Rust Hours

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0-blue.svg)

A Tampermonkey script for serious Rust admins and players. This tool digs into BattleMetrics player profiles and reveals the two most critical statistics:

- **True total hours spent on Rust servers**
- **The first-ever tracked appearance on a Rust server**

---

## 🔍 The Problem

You check someone’s Steam profile and see "Time Played: 6,000 hours." Impressive… or is it?

For all you know, they could’ve spent most of that time AFK in the main menu.

This tool gives you the real picture by checking and adding up the actual time spent playing on Rust servers.

Whether you're verifying someone manually or using BattleMetrics, this script automatically totals their playtime across all servers—no more clicking and adding each one by hand.

## ✅ The Solution

This script adds a single button to every BattleMetrics player profile. When clicked, it calculates and shows:

1. **Total Rust Hours** – The sum of all `timePlayed` values for Rust-identified servers.
2. **First Seen on Rust** – The earliest `firstSeen` date across all Rust servers visited.

No guessing. Just accurate, Rust-specific stats in seconds.

2. A new button will appear:

   ```
   [ Get True Rust Hours ]
   ```

3. Click it. The following results will appear:

   ```
   Total Rust Hours: 4321.56
   ```

## 🚀 Installation

To use this script, install a user script manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Install a Script Manager**  
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox)  
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  

2. **Install This Script**  

   ```
   https://github.com/jlaiii/BattleMetrics-True-Rust-Hours-First-Seen-Checker/raw/refs/heads/main/BattleMetrics%20True%20Rust%20Hours%20&%20First%20Seen%20Checker-1.0.user.js
   ```

3. Your script manager will ask you to confirm. Click **Install**.

## 🧠 How It Works (For Nerds)

BattleMetrics player pages include a hidden `<script id="storeBootstrap">` tag with a full JSON data dump.

The script does this:

1. Parses that JSON to grab player stats.
2. Loops through each server.
3. If `game_id === 'rust'`, it adds the `timePlayed` and checks the `firstSeen` date.
4. Shows the final results in fixed-position, styled boxes.
5. Checks for stale data (wrong player ID) and reloads the page if needed.
